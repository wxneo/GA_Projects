 HDB resale flat prices span a big range and seem to be influenced by different features of the flat. The general public may not be well-equipped with the information needed to aid their Real Estate decision making process. We have decided to develop a product where the general public can check the predicted HDB resale flat pricing, and answer common questions such as:
1. What are the available options given my current budget?
2. Which flat types and where can I afford as a buyer?
3. What price should I set when I sell my flat?
4. How to market my flat to increase its selling price?
